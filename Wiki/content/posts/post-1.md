Maize, commonly known as corn, is a remarkable cereal grain that originated in southern Mexico over 10,000 years ago, and is known for its immense potential for regenerative farming practices. It is hailed as the “queen of cereals” due to its outstanding genetic yield potential and remarkable adaptability. Maize’s leafy stalks produce ears filled with kernels or seeds, which are fruits. It averagely yields 
4,800kg per hectare.

 ### Regenerative Farming Techniques for Maize:  
Intercropping: Planting legumes or cover crops alongside maize to improve soil fertility, prevent erosion, and suppress weeds and pest invasion. Ensure that there are no competitions for resources ( e.g sunlight,water) among these crops.

Conservation Tillage: Implementing reduced tillage or no-till methods to minimize soil disturbance and retain organic matter.

Crop Rotation: Rotating maize with other crops to break pest and disease cycles and maintain soil fertility.
Besides beans, you can rotate maize with soyabeans and cowpeas; brassicas such as kales, cabbages, cauliflower; solanaceae crops such as potatoes, eggplant and tomatoes. Fodder crops such as lucerne can also be used since it also helps in fixing nitrogen in the soil.

Agroforestry: Introducing trees or shrubs in maize fields to provide shade, shelter beneficial insects, and enhance ecosystem services.

Water Management: Efficient irrigation practices, such as drip irrigation or rainwater harvesting, to minimize water usage and improve water efficiency.

### Soil Health and Nutrient Management: 
Composting: Utilizing crop residues and organic waste to produce compost for enriching soil organic matter and supplying nutrients.

Green Manure Cover Crops: Growing nitrogen-fixing cover crops, like legumes, to improve soil fertility and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers.

Organic Fertilizers: Opting for natural nutrient sources, such as compost, manure, or biofertilizers( e.g NPK biofertilizer), to reduce chemical inputs and enhance long-term soil health.


 ### Integrated Pest and Disease Management:  
Biological Control: Encouraging natural enemies of pests, such as predatory insects or beneficial nematodes, to minimize pesticide use.

Trap Crops: Planting specific crops to attract pests away from maize fields, reducing the need for chemical interventions. Examples are beans and other legumes.

Disease-Resistant Varieties: Selecting maize varieties with natural resistance to common diseases, reducing the reliance on fungicides.

### Climate Resilience and Adaptation: 
Drought-Tolerant Varieties: Cultivating maize varieties that are well-adapted to water scarcity and exhibit resilience during drought conditions.

Climate-Smart Practices: Implementing strategies like agroforestry, mulching, and microclimate management to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

### Harvesting and Post-Harvest Practices:  
Efficient Grain Drying: Utilizing energy-efficient and environmentally friendly methods for drying maize, such as solar drying or improved storage facilities.

Value Addition: Encouraging farmers to explore processing techniques that add value to maize products, reducing post-harvest losses and increasing income opportunities.
